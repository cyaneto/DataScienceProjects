This is my first unguided deep learning project. Its a NLP for tring to classify tweets based on if they ara reporting a disaster or not. I made the code based on some projects of DataCamp that i tryed and this page: https://realpython.com/python-keras-text-classification/#convolutional-neural-networks-cnn

My goal here was to learn more about NLP and deep learning with Keras.
